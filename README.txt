adding this as a test

Testing Homework problem 1: There is a driver function in split_test, please use it to see everything work on my sample case. 
Please use this command to compile 
g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 split_test.cpp split.cpp -o split

The actual split function however is simply in split.cpp

Testing Homework problem 2: unrolled Linked lists
to test this, please follow same format as in assignment, but uncomment
each labeled test to run each test seperately
to compile, please use  g++ -g -Wall ulliststr.cpp ulliststr_test.cpp -o ulliststr_test
then run ./ulliststr_test to run the file, but please 

remember to uncomment each case
